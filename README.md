# GroceryList
This project is the first version of a program I developed to generate a grocery list.

## How is this project useful?

My family orders groceries once every month. Before developing this project, we manually noted down all the required groceries for the month and sent the list to the shop via message or fax.

To automate this process, I developed this first version in June 2021 using Python and Tkinter. 
This version offers a GUI interface to create a list based on a provided template. 
Although it helped speed up the process, it had several drawbacks, such as limited usabilityâ€”the software could only be executed on my laptop due to the required packages.

In 2024, the project was redone to address these drawbacks and enhance the overall user experience. 
The code for the new version can be found in another repo called **GroceryList-Ver2**.

## Prerequisites for Using the System
- Python 3.x
- pip
- `docx` module
- Any word processing tool such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer, etc.

## Using the System

1. Open the code in an IDE and execute it from there.
2. Ensure that the file hierarchy is preserved as uploaded in this repo.
3. Once the program starts execution successfully, a window will open.
4. Click on "Start Ordering" to create a list.
5. Enter the current month and year and the quantity of each grocery item required.
6. Click on "Submit" to generate the list.
7. The generated list can be found under the `program_outputs` folder.
8. Open the list and make any necessary changes.
9. Save the modified file under the `FINAL DOCUMENTS` folder for future reference.
